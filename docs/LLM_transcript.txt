Prompt 1: "Explain to me what solutions.py has right now in 
the context of this project, and what is required for me to complete the 
missing functionality. How may I go about completing it?"
LLM Response 1: "Purpose:
The file is a stub for the function is_allocation_feasible, which determines if a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited resource capacities.

Contents:

Imports: Dict, List, Union from typing for type hints.
Defines Number as Union[int, float] for flexibility in resource values.
The function is_allocation_feasible is defined with docstrings explaining its purpose and arguments.
The function currently raises NotImplementedError, meaning it does not perform any logic yet.
What Is Required
You need to implement the logic for is_allocation_feasible. Specifically:

Inputs:

resources: a dictionary mapping resource names to their total available capacity.
requests: a list of dictionaries, each representing a request for resources (resource name → amount required).
Output:

Return True if all requests can be satisfied without exceeding any resource's capacity.
Return False otherwise.
How to Complete It
Aggregate Requests:
For each resource, sum up the total amount requested across all requests.

Compare to Available Capacity:
For each resource, check if the total requested amount is less than or equal to the available capacity.

Return Result:

If all resources can satisfy the requests, return True.
If any resource is over-requested, return False."

--------------------------------------------------
Prompt 2: "Is my current implementation of the code correct?"
LLM Response 2: "Your current implementation mostly works, but it has a significant issue:

Problem
You are modifying the resources dictionary in-place as you subtract amounts for each request. This means:

If the function is called multiple times, the original resources dictionary will be changed, which can lead to unexpected behavior elsewhere in your code.
Modifying input arguments is generally discouraged unless explicitly intended.
Other Considerations
You correctly check if each request is a dictionary.
You return False if a resource is requested that does not exist.
You return False if any resource is over-allocated.
Recommendation
Fix:
Work on a copy of the resources dictionary to avoid side effects."

Prompt 3: "how can I run the pytest code from the command line using the one I have already isntalled?"
LLM Response 3: "You already have pytest installed, but you must run it the same way it was installed and not run the test file directly.

Below is the correct, minimal way to run pytest with what you already have.

✅ The ONE correct command you should use

From the project root:

/bin/python3.11 -m pytest


Or if you want just that file:

/bin/python3.11 -m pytest src/test_solution.py


That’s it."
